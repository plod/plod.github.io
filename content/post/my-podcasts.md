With my new job I do a lot of commuting and during this time, and while running I listen to a lot of podcasts to keep on top of things and for self improvement. I am always looking for new podcasts and so I thought I'd share what I'm currently listening to which can hopefully help others find something useful.

Also pocket casts is my all time favourite app so seriously check that out.
