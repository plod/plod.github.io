Last Saturday I attended [Developer Developer Developer Wales](https://www.dddwales.com/) with Nigel, Dai, Pete and we bumped into James Alfie.

# So what is DDD Wales?

>The UK's premier FREE Developer conference is coming to Wales! Since its inception in 2005, DDD has spread across the UK and throughout other parts of the world, as far afield as Melbourne and Perth. This time though it is heading to Swansea!
>
>DDD is a free one day technical event for developers. Itâ€™s been just over 10 years since DDD was first formed and as a conference it has generated many spin-offs, as well as nurturing talented speakers, who have gone on to become Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals, Microsoft FTEs and to present at National and International Conferences.
>
>DDD was always envisioned as a day of learning, discussion, contribution and involvement in the community, from across the UK. The goal of DDD is to provide free technical education with the added benefit of the networking possibilities with peers and the development of relationships across the .NET Industry!

Based on the title of the conference, and the Microsoft connection I am inclined to believed it has something to do with Steve Balmer: {{< youtube Vhh_GeBPOhs >}}

I have to say I have been to paid conferences that were not as good as this event was, it was amazing, I'll go back next year and maybe speak at one sometime.
