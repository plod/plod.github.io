### 2017 will be the year of the runs üèÉüí© for me

What does that mean?

<blockquote><dfn>Run</dfn>...<ol start="5"><li>To extend or persist, statically or dynamically, through space or time.</li><ol start="2"><li>(intransitive) To extend in time, to last, to continue (usually with a measure phrase).</li><ul><li>The sale will run for ten days.‚ÄÉ The contract runs through 2008.‚ÄÉ The meeting ran late.‚ÄÉ The book runs 655 pages.‚ÄÉ The speech runs as follows: ‚Ä¶‚Äé</li></ul></ol></ol>... <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/run" target="_blank">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/run</a></blockquote>

I am going to run at least 1 mile (though often more than that) every day for 2017. I am not going to have just a run of runs I am hoping to:<ol>
<li>Run at least a mile</li>
<li>Cycle at least three miles</li>
<li>Continue my Duolingo Welsh streak: <sub>https://www.duolingo.com/plodtv</sub></li>
<li>Continue my Free Code Camp streak: <sub>https://www.freecodecamp.com/plod</sub></li>
</ol>

I will/have started some of these runs (streaks) before 2017 but the important pledge is that from the 1<sup>st</sup> of January = until the 31<sup>st</sup> of December I will have an unbroken run of these things.

This is going to be very difficult to juggle. I think the cycling part maybe the bit that falls hardest by the wayside. To combat this I have signed up for the Audax uk Mileater Award for the year http://www.aukweb.net/results/mileater/.

I am going to use this to record my mileage for both running and cycling.

We have also sorted out a strava club for those who are doing just the running part of this challenge: https://www.strava.com/clubs/yearoftheruns

I am also hoping to get my favourite instagram picture of the weeks activitys printed and inserted into the diary. This is a new challenge for me, and it will be a challenge to complete next year. Here's to challenging ourselves üç∫.
