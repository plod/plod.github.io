As part of my job with [DevOpsGroup](https://www.devopsgroup.com/) I've been doing more and more work with my clients in the windows space, as a result I got the opportunity to attend [WinOps 2018](https://www.winops.org/london/) last november.

# So what is WinOps?

> WinOps (a portmanteau of "Windows" and "DevOps") is a term used referring to the cultural movement of DevOps practices for a Microsoft-centric view. It emphasizes the use of the cloud, automation and integrating development and IT operations into one fluid method on the Windows platform.[^fn1]

After work I went up on the train to London with some work colleagues, we checked into our hotel before I went to the Microsoft Reactor for a meetup:

## [It's DevOps month! A one-off chance to get personal with a Microsoft Legend!](https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Developer/events/lqvhfqyxpbrb/)

This was a fantastic meetup and it was great to hear about Martin Woodward's experiences with digital transformations in such a tech giant such as [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com). I couldn't believe that MS has had to deal with the exact same pain points that many of my clients deal with, it really helped me to understand that these pain points moving to DevOps are almost universal.
