## Ultimate Go

Earlier this month I attended [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/) Ultimate Go Training given by Bill Kennedy (https://www.goinggo.net/). Todd McLeod of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/ had recommended it, and as I had been working my way through Bill's book [Go in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action) I was very keen to take my Go to the next level.

The course was hosted at [Hailo](https://www.hailoapp.com/)'s HQ in central London. Big shout out to them for hosting it, and for the excellent facilities! I took the whole family up to Cambridge to stay with friends, and then commuted into central London each day for the course.

Bill is a very passionate guy and I think he could get motivate excitement in computer programming and advanced concepts in anybody. I learnt a lot of things that I'd not put much thought into, and some anti patterns that I thought I'd been doing to improve things but had essentially been slowing things down. You can get a background idea about the course from it's [github](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/courses/ultimate), or it is worth listening to this weeks [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime-6/) podcast where you can hear Bill talk about a few of the topics of the course.

I thoroughly reccomend anybody no matter what level you are at to give the training a go (pardon the pun) Bill seems to be everywhere all the time, so I'm sure you can fit it in somewhere! Oh and he signed my Go in Action book üòÅ!
