On Febuary the 16th go released it's newest version 1.8. You can read about this release [here](https://blog.golang.org/go1.8). I presented at the [Cardiff Go](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-Go-Meetup/events/237158460/) meetup group's release party on the 15th. Considering how I am not the greatest speaker in public, it went very well. I was pretty nervous to start, but nerves slowly faded especially when I got to talk about my favourite new features (http2 pushPromice etc). You can see my slides [here](https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/plod/go-1.8-release-party/presentation.slide#1).

Everyone seemed to enjoy and I got a lot of positive feedback afterwards.
