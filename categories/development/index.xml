      <description>As part of my job with DevOpsGroup I&#39;ve been doing more and more work with my clients in the windows space, as a result I got the opportunity to attend WinOps 2018 last november.
So what is WinOps?  WinOps (a portmanteau of &amp;ldquo;Windows&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;) is a term used referring to the cultural movement of DevOps practices for a Microsoft-centric view. It emphasizes the use of the cloud, automation and integrating development and IT operations into one fluid method on the Windows platform.</description>

      <description>On Febuary the 16th go released it&#39;s newest version 1.8. You can read about this release here. I presented at the Cardiff Go meetup group&#39;s release party on the 15th. Considering how I am not the greatest speaker in public, it went very well. I was pretty nervous to start, but nerves slowly faded especially when I got to talk about my favourite new features (http2 pushPromice etc). You can see my slides here.</description>

      <description>2017 will be the year of the runs üèÉüí© for me What does that mean?
I am going to run at least 1 mile (though often more than that) every day for 2017. I am not going to have just a run of runs I am hoping to:I will/have started some of these runs (streaks) before 2017 but the important pledge is that from the 1stof January = until the 31stof December I will have an unbroken run of these things.</description>

      <description>Ultimate Go Earlier this month I attended Ardan Labs Ultimate Go Training given by Bill Kennedy (https://www.goinggo.net/). Todd McLeod of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/ had recommended it, and as I had been working my way through Bill&#39;s book Go in Action I was very keen to take my Go to the next level.
The course was hosted at Hailo&amp;lsquo;s HQ in central London. Big shout out to them for hosting it, and for the excellent facilities!</description>

      <description>So I decided to do the projects on Project Euler to help with my Go learning (and to get my maths head working again), I&#39;d forgotten how much fun the problems were.
What is Project Euler?
 Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.</description>

      <description>goSwitchBackup is Go program I wrote, to automate the backing up of Cisco switches over SSH for the network boys in work. It essentially SSHs (can you use it like a verb like that?) into an IP (Which should be the address of a Cisco switch) using the password, once it receives the prompt character it trys to escalate privileges using: enable Once it sees the &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; character it then tries to run the backup command: copy running-config tftpIt will then give the TFTP server address used when the program was invoked, and name the file:</description>
