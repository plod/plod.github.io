&lt;h2 id=&#34;ultimate-go&#34;&gt;Ultimate Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I attended &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ardanlabs.com/&#34;&gt;Ardan Labs&lt;/a&gt; Ultimate Go Training given by Bill Kennedy (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goinggo.net/&#34;&gt;https://www.goinggo.net/&lt;/a&gt;). Todd McLeod of the Udemy course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/&#34;&gt;https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/&lt;/a&gt; had recommended it, and as I had been working my way through Bill&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action&#34;&gt;Go in Action&lt;/a&gt; I was very keen to take my Go to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was hosted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hailoapp.com/&#34;&gt;Hailo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s HQ in central London. Big shout out to them for hosting it, and for the excellent facilities! I took the whole family up to Cambridge to stay with friends, and then commuted into central London each day for the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill is a very passionate guy and I think he could get motivate excitement in computer programming and advanced concepts in anybody. I learnt a lot of things that I&amp;rsquo;d not put much thought into, and some anti patterns that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d been doing to improve things but had essentially been slowing things down. You can get a background idea about the course from it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/courses/ultimate&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, or it is worth listening to this weeks &lt;a href=&#34;https://changelog.com/gotime-6/&#34;&gt;Go Time&lt;/a&gt; podcast where you can hear Bill talk about a few of the topics of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly reccomend anybody no matter what level you are at to give the training a go (pardon the pun) Bill seems to be everywhere all the time, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can fit it in somewhere! Oh and he signed my Go in Action book üòÅ!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Euler</title>
      <link>https://plod.tv/post/project-euler/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2016 10:36:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://plod.tv/post/project-euler/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I decided to do the projects on Project Euler to help with my Go learning (and to get my maths head working again), I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how much fun the problems were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Project Euler?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check them out here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://projecteuler.net/&#34;&gt;https://projecteuler.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to push my solutions to github here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plod/projectEuler/&#34;&gt;https://github.com/plod/projectEuler/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://projecteuler.net/profile/plod.png&#34; alt=&#34;Euler Profile Picture&#34; title=&#34;plod&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Euler says on each solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside Project Euler. If you want to share your insights then please go to thread 8 in the discussion forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope that people do not see this as deprivation or use the results to spoil their critical thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing goSwitchBackup</title>
      <link>https://plod.tv/post/announcing-goSwitchBackup/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;goSwitchBackup is Go program I wrote, to automate the backing up of Cisco switches over SSH for the network boys in work. It essentially SSHs (can you use it like a verb like that?) into an IP (Which should be the address of a Cisco switch) using the password, once it receives the prompt character it trys to escalate privileges using: enable Once it sees the &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; character it then tries to run the backup command: copy running-config tftpIt will then give the TFTP server address used when the program was invoked, and name the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;switchBackup-IP-OF-SWITCH-RFC3339timestamp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I may make this configurable later&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the code on github here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plod/goSwitchBackup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/plod/goSwitchBackup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you run or compile, or just go run the code, pass the -help command for helps with flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comments or requests for more information please post in the comments below (I am still quite new to Go so any helpful pointers would also be gratefully received).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;todo-wishlist&#34;&gt;todo/wishlist:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add potential TFTP server inside the program itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare previous backup with current backup and send alert of changes (SMTP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a verbose switch to echo some of the commented stuff that helps debug issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
