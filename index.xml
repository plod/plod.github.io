      <description>On Febuary the 16th go released it&amp;rsquo;s newest version 1.8. You can read about this release here. I presented at the Cardiff Go meetup group&amp;rsquo;s release party on the 15th. Considering how I am not the greatest speaker in public, it went very well. I was pretty nervous to start, but nerves slowly faded especially when I got to talk about my favourite new features (http2 pushPromice etc). You can see my slides here.</description>

      <description>I decided that I wanted to move away from self hosted for this website, mostly for resilience (I am often tinkering with thisthat server), though I also wanted to play some with Travis CI to help contributing with more FOSS and playing with different technologies.
I followed the tutorial here paying special attention to the note at the bottom. In a very recent version of hugo there seems to be a problem with:</description>

      <description>Ultimate Go Earlier this month I attended Ardan Labs Ultimate Go Training given by Bill Kennedy (https://www.goinggo.net/). Todd McLeod of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/ had recommended it, and as I had been working my way through Bill&amp;rsquo;s book Go in Action I was very keen to take my Go to the next level.
The course was hosted at Hailo&amp;rsquo;s HQ in central London. Big shout out to them for hosting it, and for the excellent facilities!</description>

      <description>So I decided to do the projects on Project Euler to help with my Go learning (and to get my maths head working again), I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how much fun the problems were.
What is Project Euler?
 Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.</description>

      <description>goSwitchBackup is Go program I wrote, to automate the backing up of Cisco switches over SSH for the network boys in work. It essentially SSHs (can you use it like a verb like that?) into an IP (Which should be the address of a Cisco switch) using the password, once it receives the prompt character it trys to escalate privileges using: enable Once it sees the &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; character it then tries to run the backup command: copy running-config tftpIt will then give the TFTP server address used when the program was invoked, and name the file:</description>

      <title>Audax: Malmesbury Mash 2016</title>

      <description>On Saturday gone, I rode my 200km Audax of the month of February &amp;ldquo;Malmesbury Mash&amp;rdquo;. I try to ride at least a 200km every month of the year to achieve the Audax UK award Randonneur Round the Year. Last year on my 12th successive month on the ride to claim this award, I managed to break my collar bone, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story entirely.
Things did not start well for the preparation for this ride.</description>

      <title>Multiple site free ssl with http2 nginx</title>

      <description>There still exists this myth that you require a single IP address per vhost for an ssl certificate. It was perpetuated because the encryption handshake used to happen before the resource required could be ascertained, thanks to some pretty serious security vulnerabilites SSL itself is pretty much a dead duck and the modern TLS has superceded it. One of the great things about TLS is SNI:
 Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the TLS computer networking protocol[1] by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process.</description>

      <title>Setting up a hugo based website on ubuntu then auto deploy using gogs&#39; webhooks</title>

      <description>What is Hugo?  Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data. And you can run Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don‚Äôt have a privileged account.</description>
