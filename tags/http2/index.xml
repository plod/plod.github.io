      <description>There still exists this myth that you require a single IP address per vhost for an ssl certificate. It was perpetuated because the encryption handshake used to happen before the resource required could be ascertained, thanks to some pretty serious security vulnerabilites SSL itself is pretty much a dead duck and the modern TLS has superceded it. One of the great things about TLS is SNI:
 Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the TLS computer networking protocol[1] by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process.</description>
