      <description>2017 will be the year of the runs üèÉüí© for me What does that mean?
I am going to run at least 1 mile (though often more than that) every day for 2017. I am not going to have just a run of runs I am hoping to:I will/have started some of these runs (streaks) before 2017 but the important pledge is that from the 1stof January = until the 31stof December I will have an unbroken run of these things.</description>
