      <description>Ultimate Go Earlier this month I attended Ardan Labs Ultimate Go Training given by Bill Kennedy (https://www.goinggo.net/). Todd McLeod of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/ had recommended it, and as I had been working my way through Bill&#39;s book Go in Action I was very keen to take my Go to the next level.
The course was hosted at Hailo&amp;lsquo;s HQ in central London. Big shout out to them for hosting it, and for the excellent facilities!</description>
