      <description>2017 will be the year of the runs üèÉüí© for me What does that mean?
I am going to run at least 1 mile (though often more than that) every day for 2017. I am not going to have just a run of runs I am hoping to:I will/have started some of these runs (streaks) before 2017 but the important pledge is that from the 1stof January = until the 31stof December I will have an unbroken run of these things.</description>

      <description>On Saturday gone, I rode my 200km Audax of the month of February &amp;ldquo;Malmesbury Mash&amp;rdquo;. I try to ride at least a 200km every month of the year to achieve the Audax UK award Randonneur Round the Year. Last year on my 12th successive month on the ride to claim this award, I managed to break my collar bone, but that&#39;s another story entirely.
Things did not start well for the preparation for this ride.</description>
