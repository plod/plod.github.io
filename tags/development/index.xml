      <description>On Febuary the 16th go released it&amp;rsquo;s newest version 1.8. You can read about this release here. I presented at the Cardiff Go meetup group&amp;rsquo;s release party on the 15th. Considering how I am not the greatest speaker in public, it went very well. I was pretty nervous to start, but nerves slowly faded especially when I got to talk about my favourite new features (http2 pushPromice etc). You can see my slides here.</description>

      <description>I decided that I wanted to move away from self hosted for this website, mostly for resilience (I am often tinkering with thisthat server), though I also wanted to play some with Travis CI to help contributing with more FOSS and playing with different technologies.
I followed the tutorial here paying special attention to the note at the bottom. In a very recent version of hugo there seems to be a problem with:</description>

      <description>Ultimate Go Earlier this month I attended Ardan Labs Ultimate Go Training given by Bill Kennedy (https://www.goinggo.net/). Todd McLeod of the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/ had recommended it, and as I had been working my way through Bill&amp;rsquo;s book Go in Action I was very keen to take my Go to the next level.
The course was hosted at Hailo&amp;rsquo;s HQ in central London. Big shout out to them for hosting it, and for the excellent facilities!</description>

      <description>goSwitchBackup is Go program I wrote, to automate the backing up of Cisco switches over SSH for the network boys in work. It essentially SSHs (can you use it like a verb like that?) into an IP (Which should be the address of a Cisco switch) using the password, once it receives the prompt character it trys to escalate privileges using: enable Once it sees the &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; character it then tries to run the backup command: copy running-config tftpIt will then give the TFTP server address used when the program was invoked, and name the file:</description>
